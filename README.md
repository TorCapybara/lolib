*lol* Image Board, image board rethought

Image Boards are very simple and are not meant for big sets of images. They are also very limited in sorting, and usually have only a few features.

This image boards has been thought from the scratch on how collection of pictures can be created and mantained.

It is the combination of classic forum and classic image board into something more powerful.
