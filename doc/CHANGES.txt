Changes for Version 0.10

* Video (After the upload the Video is placed in the background threads queue. It gets the metadata, hashes and it generates a Contact Sheet. Before that is complete and successfull the Video is not accessible.)
* Like posts
* Board Access: different boards now can have different settings in user rights. 
* Handling of .csv, .sfv, .md5 and .sha1 files (Each Board Thread and Name Space generates these files for you. If you have a missing files list from Programs like The!Checker you can use the Fills Search now. You can upload any of the hash files from above to generate a list. Certainly a help for serious collectors.)
* Formatting help 
* A post which has open reports states the number of reports hanging on the post. 
* Menu improvements 
* CSS is set in the User Settings (new menu item in Profile) 
* Session handling, no more random log outs (hopefully)
